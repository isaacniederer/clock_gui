# Gui Clock

## Main Idea

The clock app on the phone is pretty convenient. It basically removes the need for a regular alarm clock and also functions as a timer and stopwatch. What I want to do is build an app for the computer that does the same thing. I always find myself working on the computer and I forgot to do something like switch out the laundry or take the dog out (I don't have a dog but the idea is still there). And to make matters worse, I will have absolutely no idea where my phone is. It doesn't matter if I set a reminder if the device I set the reminder on is gone. There are probably hundreds of different clock applications I can download, but I think it would be fun to design my own.

## Functionality

Like I said, I want an app on the computer that will do the same things as a phone. Here is a list of ideas that I would like my clock to be able to do,

- Timers
- Stopwatch
- Alarm system
- Use minimal resources
- Real-time display

### Timers

I want to be able to set a timer for any arbitrary amount of time. It will have it's limits. No need to set a 6 hour timer if I can also just set an alarm for 6 hours in the future.

### Stopwatch

This will work as a standard stopwatch that can be controlled either by clicking left mouse button or pressing the space bar.

This will also function as a rubik's cube session tracker. The stopwatch should be able to be activated by a press on the spacebar and then save times in a session. Leaving the session will prompt the user to save the session in which case the user will be able to save the file.

It would be nice to be able to add functionality such as lifetime stats, but this is also supposed to be a clock first and the rubik's cube timer is just another feature of the stopwatch.

### Alarm System

I would like to be able to set alarms on the computer that will send a notification to the computer displaying the message associated with the alarm.

### Minimal Resources

I would like the program to be able to run in the background indefinitely or potentially always. The clock itself doesn't need to always run itself but just get data when it is needed. Or somehow tie a notification to the system clock for the alarms to work properly.

### Real-time display

It would be nice to be able to open this app and display the time or potentially use it as a screensaver. 




A lot of the things I would like this clock to do are things I have never done before. Creating GUIs is one of those things. There are many things that I likely won't be able to accomplish. But I would still like to attempt as much as possible. For this project, Boot.dev says to spend 20 to 40 hours on it. I know that the time is not technically limited and I can spend as much time as I would like. But, I decided that I am going to build a base clock system first. Completely bare bones with very limited functionality. From there, I can add everything else.

My priorities in order are,

1. Stopwatch/Timers
2. Alarm System
3. Being able to run in the background
4. Designing a clock face to display the time
5. Aesthetics
6. Screen saver
7. Rubik's cube session tracker

Things like the screen saver and rubik's cube stuff would be really cool to implement. But they are completely unnecessary for the clock to function normally. So there is no reason to implement them until I know that everything else is working.
